## How to Run 

Make sure to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed. Download the entire package onto your computer and `cd` into the `Battle` folder. Then run the `main.py` file with this command: `python main.py`. Directions may slightly differ depending on the type of system you are running this on. This program was made using Python 3.7.0 on Windows OS.

**NOTE:** Don't run this program with the Windows Command Prompt. It will still work but the colors don't show up correctly.

## To Win the Game
Your only goal is to reduce your enemies HP to 0. If your HP reaches zero, you lose. If both you and your enemies HP both reach zero on the same turn, you still lose. Good luck.
